Uber Data Analytics | Modern Data Engineering GCP Project

**Introduction**

This project showcases an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for processing Uber trip records data. The pipeline retrieves data from the TLC Trip Record Data provided by New York City's Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) for yellow and green taxi trips. It includes various fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, locations, distances, fares, rate types, payment types, and passenger counts reported by drivers.
